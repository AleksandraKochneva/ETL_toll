##Build an ETL Pipeline using Airflow

This is a part of the final project from IBM Data Engineering course that aims to de-congest the national highways by analyzing the road traffic data from different toll plazas. Each highway is operated by a different toll operator with a different IT setup that uses different file formats. The job is to collect data available in different formats and consolidate it into a single file.
